# Project Proposal, Part 2
This project is focusing on television and movies in the entertainment industry over the past several years, and how streaming platforms like Netflix are disrupting that established industry.  The new distribution platform is shifting viewers away from traditional television and movie theaters and towards streaming content on personal devices.

#### User Research Protocol
**Target Audience:** Higher-ups at bigger production companies.  
**Approach to identifying representative individuals:**  As I will do not have access to interview my target audience, I aim to reach a small group of individuals with diverse backgrounds to get a broad perspective.  My group of interviewees will include two Heinz students and one medical student at the University of Pittsburgh, two females and one male, and range from ages 23 through 37.
