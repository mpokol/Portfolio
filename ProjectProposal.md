# Project Proposal
This project is focusing on television and movies in the entertainment industry over the past several years, and how streaming platforms like Netflix are disrupting that established industry.  The new distribution platform is shifting viewers away from traditional television and movie theaters and towards streaming content on personal devices.

1. But movie production is steady?

2. Movie Theater ticket sales are decreasing.
3. Younger generations are not watching traditional telivision.
4. There is a steady increase in Netflix subscribers
5. Call to action: Big production companies should be thinking about changing their business model because the internet is changing the way customers want to view content.

### Data Sources

### Method and Medium
Data visualizations like the ones sketched above will be done primarily using Tableau and RAWGraphs.  These platforms were chosen because of their versatility and ability to create complex graphs in a user-friendly manner.  This is especially important because, as seen in the data sources section, my data is coming from a multitude of sources.  The visualizations created will be tested and will go through multiple iterations over the course of the project based on user feedback.  

The project will include a series of wireframes and storyboards made from the wireframing platform, Balsamiq.  These wireframes and storyboards will also be tested and go through multiple iterations based on user feedback.  The final website will be completed using Shorthand as the medium.  I plan to use Canva in conjunction with Shorthand to add to the story I want to tell using engaging transitions, particularly because my project itself is focused on the transition of an industry.
