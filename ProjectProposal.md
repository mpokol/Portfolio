# Project Proposal
This project is focusing on television and movies in the entertainment industry over the past several years, and how streaming platforms like Netflix are disrupting that established industry.  The new distribution platform is shifting viewers away from traditional television and movie theaters and towards streaming content on personal devices.

1. But movie production is steady?

4. There is a steady increase in Netflix subscribers
5. Call to action: Big production companies should be thinking about changing their business model because the internet is changing the way customers want to view content.

### Data Sources
My first data source is located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies/version/2).
It is a dataset containing 6820 movies (220 movies per year, 1986-2016) scraped from IMDb and contains information about each movieâ€™s budget, production company, country of origin, director, genre, gross revenue, IMDb rating, and release date.  This data will be used primarily for the first plot regarding movie production over time.

My second dataset is located here: https://www.kaggle.com/clouds0715/thefilmindustry#the%20film%20industry_US_08-17_English.csv
This data was pulled from here https://www.the-numbers.com/market/ and contains data on number of screens, average ticket price, total gross, the number of sold tickets and the number of movies released in United States.  This dataset will provide the data for the visualization on movie ticket sales.

My third dataset is located here: https://www-statista-com/statistics/786371/time-spent-traditional-tv-age/
The data comes from a survey done by Nielsen Holdings Plc and was originally published by MarketingCharts here: https://www.marketingcharts.com/featured-105414.  Nielsen Holdings Plc is an American information, data and measurement firm that provides research, ratings, and data for different media types.  This data will be used to show that it's primarily older generations that watch traditional television.

My fourth dataset is located here: https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us/
This data is sourced from Netflix and contains data on streaming subscribers from 2011 to 2019.  This dataset will be used to emphasize the increase in streaming services over time.



### Method and Medium
Data visualizations like the ones sketched above will be done primarily using Tableau and RAWGraphs.  These platforms were chosen because of their versatility and ability to create complex graphs in a user-friendly manner.  This is especially important because, as seen in the data sources section, my data is coming from a multitude of sources.  The visualizations created will be tested and will go through multiple iterations over the course of the project based on user feedback.  

The project will include a series of wireframes and storyboards made from the wireframing platform, Balsamiq.  These wireframes and storyboards will also be tested and go through multiple iterations based on user feedback.  The final website will be completed using Shorthand as the medium.  I plan to use Canva in conjunction with Shorthand to add to the story I want to tell using engaging transitions, particularly because my project itself is focused on the transition of an industry.
