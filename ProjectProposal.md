# Project Proposal
This project is focusing on television and movies in the entertainment industry over the past several years, and how streaming platforms like Netflix are disrupting that established industry.  The new distribution platform is shifting viewers away from traditional television and movie theaters and towards streaming content on personal devices.

1. But movie production is steady?  
I plan to start by briefly looking at movie production over the past several years. This would show that movie production has been increasing fairly consistently. It's easy to think based off of this and similar graphs and statistics that the big production companies are continuing to do well and that the entertainment industry is stable.

2. Movie Theater ticket sales are decreasing.  
This section will look more closely at how consumers are actually viewing those new movies. Ticket sales for movie theaters in the US have been significantly decreasing over time while the price of a ticket has been significantly increasing. This should be a red flag for traditional production companies because their movies are reaching much fewer people than they were before. Prior to streaming services, you had to go to the movie theater to see new content. Now, with platforms like Netflix creating original content that is just shown on their streaming services, new content is viewable more easily. Content is also bundled together so there are many more options.

3. Younger generations are not watching traditional television.  
This section will focus on the fact that younger generations are not watching television and are instead switching to streaming shows. As production companies that make money off of television advertisements based on number of viewers, this is also a huge red flag because the number of viewers is steadily decreasing.

4. There is a steady increase in Netflix subscribers.  
This is in conjunction with the last points about fewer and fewer people watching traditional television and going out to movie theaters. Netflix and other streaming services have created a new distribution platform for almost all media types. Not only is this platform less expensive than traditional cable, it is easier on viewers as well. There are more options because shows are bundled, shows can be watched on the customer's timetable, and the use of "big data" allows streaming services to anticipate what a customer will enjoy watching because of previous behaviors. The changes to the distribution channels have opened up many more areas of change in the industry. Production companies need to re-evaluate their old business models because the entire industry is currently going through a foundational change.

5. Call to action: Big production companies should be thinking about changing their business model because the internet is changing the way customers want to view content.

   I originally created these graphs separately and realized in putting this all together how many line graphs there are. I plan on working through how to better represent some of these graphs in part two of the project proposal with the help of feedback from others.

### Data Sources
My first data source is located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies/version/2). It is a dataset containing 6820 movies (220 movies per year, 1986-2016) scraped from IMDb and contains information about each movieâ€™s budget, production company, country of origin, director, genre, gross revenue, IMDb rating, and release date. This data will be used primarily for the first plot regarding movie production over time.

My second dataset is located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/clouds0715/thefilmindustry#the%20film%20industry_US_08-17_English.csv). This data was pulled from https://www.the-numbers.com/market/ and contains data on number of screens, average ticket price, total gross, the number of sold tickets and the number of movies released in United States. This dataset will provide the data for the visualization on movie ticket sales.

My third dataset is located [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/786371/time-spent-traditional-tv-age/). The data comes from a survey done by Nielsen Holdings Plc and was originally published by MarketingCharts here: https://www.marketingcharts.com/featured-105414.  Nielsen Holdings Plc is an American information, data and measurement firm that provides research, ratings, and data for different media types. This data will be used to show that it's primarily older generations that watch traditional television.

My fourth dataset is located [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us/). This data is sourced from Netflix and contains data on streaming subscribers from 2011 to 2019. This dataset will be used to emphasize the increase in streaming services over time.



### Method and Medium
Data visualizations like the ones sketched above will be done primarily using Tableau and RAWGraphs.  These platforms were chosen because of their versatility and ability to create complex graphs in a user-friendly manner.  This is especially important because, as seen in the data sources section, my data is coming from a multitude of sources.  The visualizations created will be tested and will go through multiple iterations over the course of the project based on user feedback.  

The project will include a series of wireframes and storyboards made from the wireframing platform, Balsamiq.  These wireframes and storyboards will also be tested and go through multiple iterations based on user feedback.  The final website will be completed using Shorthand as the medium.  I plan to use Canva in conjunction with Shorthand to add to the story I want to tell using engaging transitions, particularly because my project itself is focused on the transition of an industry.
