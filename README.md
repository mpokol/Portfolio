Public Portfolio for 94-870: Telling Stories with Data

### About Me
My name is Muriel Pokol (she/her) and I am currently in my final year of a Masters of Science at Carnegie Mellonâ€™s Policy and Management School, where my focus is Data Analytics.  I graduated from Carnegie Mellon undergrad in 2018 with a double major in Social and Decision Science and Behavioral Economics.  In other words, I studied a combination of psychology and statistics in Decision Science, and a combination of psychology and economics in Behavioral Economics.  

I chose to attend graduate school straight out of undergrad because as I neared the end of my undergrad career I started doing more and more that focused on programming in analytics, and I realized that that was a more what I could see myself doing as a career.  I knew that CMU had a program that would give me a lot of exposure to the technology that I was enjoying working with but would still keep that human interaction, big-picture part.  

Over this past summer I interned at 3Vue LLC, a consulting company in the Chicago area, where I worked a lot in Qliksense creating visualizations and building dashboards under the supervision of the web development team.  I hope to pursue a career as a Data Analysist with a strong focus on data visualization and its role in Bussiness Intelligence.

### What I hope to learn...
I hope to learn about new data visualization tools and get a deeper dive into data visualization tools I've already worked with, such as Tableau.  I am also interested in getting a more design-oriented perspective to data visualization than I have in previous courses.  While the visualizations I've created in the past have not been thoughtless, I hope to add a level of intention to all aspects of my visualizations.
