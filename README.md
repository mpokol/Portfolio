Public Portfolio for CMU Heinz College Course 94-870, Telling Stories with Data

### About Me
My name is Muriel Pokol (she/hers) and I am currently finishing my final year as a masterâ€™s student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying Public Policy and Management on the Data Analytics track.  I very much enjoy data visualization and have explored that in previous internships.  I hope to pursue a career as a Data Analysist with a strong focus on data visualization and its role in Bussiness Intelligence.

### What I hope to learn...
I hope to learn about new data visualization tools and get a deeper dive into data visualization tools I've already worked with, such as Tableau.  I am also interested in getting a more design-oriented perspective to data visualization than I have in previous courses.  

### Portfolio
Here is where my visualizations will go!
